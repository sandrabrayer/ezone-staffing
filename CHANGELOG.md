EZONE-ECOSYSTEM-STATUS.md added at the repo root — the July 4 merged cross-app ecosystem status doc, distributed to the root of all six E-Zone repos so every project/session starts from the true state.
Added
Budgets — frontend (Part 4b, `public/index.html`). `loadData()` now pulls `budgets`. The central dashboard gains a "תקציב מול עלות — <month>" section: one row per house (budget, month cost, variance ₪ as יתרה/חריגה, utilization %, and a colored status — green within / amber over ≤10% / red over >10%), each with an "עריכת תקציב" control, plus a combined summary row across the houses that have a budget set. Every house card on the dashboard shows a compact budget line under its cost; the per-house view shows the same line plus an edit control in its head. Budgets and costs both track the selected month, and a month-specific budget overrides the house's `default`. New budget-editor modal (`#budgetOverlay`) — amount + a "כברירת מחדל לכל החודשים" checkbox that posts `month=default` instead of the selected month; `saveBudget()` posts `setBudget` and patches the in-memory `BUDGETS` from the server echo (no full reload). New helpers `budgetLineHtml` / `budgetSummarySection` / `houseBudgetControlHtml` / `openBudget` / `closeBudget` / `saveBudget` and `.budget-table` / `.bud-*` / `.house-budget` / `.checkline` styles. Tests in `tests/page-load.test.js`: summary table + combined row present, green within-budget row, red over-budget row, house-view line + control, `openBudget`→`saveBudget` posts `setBudget` for the selected month, default-checkbox posts `month=default`.
Budgets — data layer + variance calc (Part 4a). New append-only `budgets` Sheet tab (`id | house | month | amount | created_at | updated_at`), created idempotently by `setupSheetsV3`; `month` is a `YYYY-MM` key or the sentinel `default` (the fallback for any month without a specific override). Two whitelisted actions, validated in `lib/validate.js` and re-validated in `apps-script/Code.gs`: `setBudget` — upsert one row per (house, month), updated in place if the pair exists (amount + updated_at, id + created_at preserved) else appended; `getBudgets` — all rows. Validation: known house, `YYYY-MM`-or-`default` month, non-negative amount (whole, capped 100,000,000). `/api/data` GET now also returns `budgets`. Pure calc helpers in `lib/calc.js`: `budgetForHouse(budgets, house, month)` resolves the amount with month-specific overriding `default` (null when none set); `budgetVariance(budget, cost)` → `{ budget, cost, variance, pct, status }` where variance is `budget − cost` (₪), pct is utilization (`cost/budget`), and status is `none` (no budget) / `ok` green (at or under) / `warn` amber (over by ≤10%) / `over` red (over by >10%). Tests: `tests/validate.test.js` (budget validation + action dispatch), `tests/server.test.js` (insert, in-place update, default+specific coexist, bad-input 400s), `tests/calc.test.js` (override resolution + every variance band incl. zero-budget edge).
Monthly actuals — month view (`public/index.html`). The cost view now carries a month picker (`<input type="month">` in the central + house page heads), defaulting to the current month and persisting across house navigation (unlike the roster search, which resets on `go()`). `loadData()` now also pulls `monthlyActuals`; `render()` rebuilds an `ACTUALS_INDEX` (assignmentId+month → row) each pass so `rosterRow()` — also invoked by the in-place roster-search re-render — can resolve a cost without recomputing. Each hourly / per_session roster row's cost cell shows `rate × actual` for the selected month when a `monthly_actuals` row exists (with a small "בפועל N ש'/מפגשים" note), or falls back to the estimate flagged with an "אומדן" badge when none exists. Fixed-salary types (full_time / part_time / fixed_retainer) are unchanged and never badged; the allowance and leave-status (חל"ד / חל"ט → 0) rules keep applying. House cost cards and the network grand-total stat reflect the selected month (`houseMonthlyTotal` / `networkMonthlyTotal`); coverage-extra and notice-period sublines keep their "active today" meaning. Changing the month re-renders the whole view (month affects every cost cell + the totals, not just the roster tables). New helpers `ensureMonth` / `fmtMonth` / `monthPickerHtml` / `onMonthChange` / `monthCostCellInner` / `houseMonthTotal` / `totalCostMonth` and `.month-picker` / `.est-badge` / `.actual-note` styles. Tests in `tests/page-load.test.js`: picker present + defaults to current month, estimate fallback badged, actual cost used (no badge), month-switch flips actual↔estimate, house total reflects the month, fixed salary unchanged.
Monthly actuals — cost fallback logic (`lib/calc.js`). Pure, shared (CommonJS + browser) helpers the month view renders from. `monthlyAssignmentCost(a, actual)` → `{ cost, isEstimate }`: an hourly / per_session assignment with a matching `monthly_actuals` row costs `rate × actual` (+ allowance); with no row it falls back to the estimate (`rate × est`) and sets `isEstimate=true` so the UI can badge it "אומדן". A recorded 0 is a real value (cost 0, not a fallback); a row that records only the other quantity (sessions on an hourly row) still counts as no hours → estimate. Fixed-salary types (full_time / part_time / fixed_retainer) are month-invariant and never flagged; leave (חל"ד / חל"ט) still zeroes the cost ahead of any actual/estimate. `indexActuals(list)` builds an `assignmentId|month` lookup; `lookupActual(idx, id, month)` reads it; `currentMonth()` returns today's `YYYY-MM`. Month-aware totals `houseMonthlyTotal` / `networkMonthlyTotal` mirror `houseTotal` / `networkTotal` but compute assignment costs for the selected month — coverage extras and pending-termination costs keep their existing "active today" semantics (they're about who is helping / leaving right now, not a historical month reconstruction), so the v3 coverage/termination cost contract is unchanged. 14 unit tests in `tests/calc.test.js`.
Monthly actuals — data layer (feature: monthly actual costs for hourly / per_session workers). Hourly (מדריכים) and per_session workers are paid by what they actually worked each month, but cost was computed from a one-time estimate on the assignment (`hourlyRate × estHours` / `sessionRate × estSessions`), so per-house costs drifted from reality. This commit adds the storage + backend surface that later commits build the month view on. New append-only `monthly_actuals` Sheet tab (`id | assignment_id | month | actual_hours | actual_sessions | note | created_at | updated_at`), created idempotently by `setupSheetsV3`. `month` is a `YYYY-MM` key; blank `actual_hours`/`actual_sessions` mean "not recorded for this type" (distinct from a recorded 0 — the reader keeps them as `null`). Two new whitelisted actions, validated in `lib/validate.js` and re-validated in `apps-script/Code.gs`: `upsertMonthlyActuals` — bulk upsert of `[{assignmentId, month, actualHours?, actualSessions?, note?}]`, exactly one row per (assignment, month), updated in place on re-upsert (id + created_at preserved, updated_at refreshed). The whole batch is validated + FK-checked (every `assignmentId` must exist) before any write, so a bad item fails the request with no partial write. `getMonthlyActuals` — `{month}` → all rows for that month. Validation: `month` format (`YYYY-MM`, real 01–12), numeric non-negative hours (2-decimal, capped 744) / sessions (whole, capped 500), each row needs at least one of hours/sessions/note, duplicate (assignment, month) pairs within one request rejected, unknown fields rejected. `/api/data` GET now also returns `monthlyActuals`. Tests: `tests/validate.test.js` (month + item + batch validation, action dispatch), `tests/server.test.js` (insert, in-place update, distinct months, unknown-assignment 404 with no partial write, bad-input 400s, `getMonthlyActuals` month filter).
Per-house roster search — a search box at the top of each house's `צוות הבית` roster section filters the שכירים + פרילנסרים tables by worker name as Moran types. Match is case-insensitive and trimmed, on the worker's display name (the roster rows are assignments, so each row's `workerId` is resolved to a name before matching). Filtering happens in place via `onRosterFilterInput()` — only the two table bodies (`#rosterSalaried` / `#rosterFreelancer`) and their count pills re-render, so the input keeps focus and caret position while typing (a full `render()` would rebuild the input and drop focus after every keystroke). The active term lives in module state (`rosterFilter`), so an edit-triggered re-render preserves the filter; navigating to a different view via `go()` resets it to empty. The headline stat cards (שיבוצים בבית, costs) are computed from the unfiltered roster — search narrows only the tables, never the totals. New internal helper `filterRoster(list, term)` and split of `rosterTable` into a reusable `rosterTableInner`.
Worker cascade-delete (`מחיקת עובד/ת + כל השיבוצים`) — a second delete button in the worker dialog for one-click cleanup of test rows that already picked up assignments. The dialog now picks exactly one of three states in `openWorker()`: (1) no references at all → the existing plain `מחיקה` (server accepts directly); (2) the worker's ONLY references are assignments → the new cascade button, with a sub-header stating how many assignments will be removed; (3) the worker has absence/coverage/archive history → neither button, deletion blocked (those are real records worth preserving, and the server's `deleteWorker` would `409` regardless). `deleteWorkerCascade()` re-checks the guard against the live cache (defends a stale modal), confirms, then deletes each assignment first (the server refuses `deleteWorker` while any assignment still references the worker) and finally the worker. Not transactional — the backend has no cascade endpoint, so it's N × `deleteAssignment` + one `deleteWorker`; on a mid-loop failure it reloads, re-renders, and surfaces the error so the partial result is visible. New internal helper `workerHasOnlyAssignmentRefs()`.
Dashboard "היעדרויות פעילות ברשת" section — read-only join across all houses, surfacing every active absence with its matching coverage (if any) at a glance. Linked rows render as `[worker] ([house]) — [reason], [dates] → מחליפה: [name] (מ[source-house])`; orphan rows (no linked coverage) get a red dashed background and a `⚠️ ללא מחליף` badge, sorted to the top of the list. Stub absences (`workerId=''`) render their name as a `(ללא רישום נעדר/ת)` placeholder so the open slot is still visible. The existing absences stat card grows a `X פעילות · Y ללא מחליף` sub-line (`· Y ללא מחליף` omitted when Y=0). New pure helper `networkAbsenceCoverageRows` in `lib/calc.js` — no side effects, the dashboard never writes. Per-house views are unchanged.
Per-house "+ עובד חדש" button — Moran's "I don't see a place to add a worker" feedback. The standalone worker-create dialog (name + notes) was already wired as a sub-flow inside the "+ שיבוץ חדש" form, but undiscoverable from the house view. This commit surfaces it as a top-level button alongside "+ שיבוץ חדש" in each house's roster section head; clicking opens the worker dialog directly (no assignment form first) and the user stays on the house view after save, with a different success toast (`העובד נוסף — אפשר להוסיף שיבוץ ידנית`) that hints at the next step. The existing assignment-form sub-flow's own toast is unchanged. Soft dup-name warning added to the dialog: typing a name that already exists on another worker surfaces an inline `⚠️ עובד/ת בשם זהה כבר קיים/ת` notice — soft only, the save proceeds (legitimate duplicates do occur). Edit mode excludes the worker being edited from the dup check, so re-saving an unchanged name never flags itself.
Changed
v3.1 — absence and coverage are now INDEPENDENT events. Previously a coverage inherited its receiving house and effective date range from its parent absence. Now every coverage carries those fields itself, and the link to an absence is optional + reference-only. This is a breaking schema + cost-contract change; a one-shot in-place migrator (`migrateCoveragesToV3_1`, idempotency flag `V3_1_MIGRATION_DONE`) rewrites existing coverage rows.
Schema (coverages tab). `providing_house` → `covering_house`; new columns `receiving_house`, `start_date`, `end_date`. `absence_id` becomes optional (`''` allowed). `setupSheetsV3` produces the new shape directly for fresh installs; `migrateCoveragesToV3_1` patches existing v3.0 sheets in-place — `covering_house` carries forward the old `providing_house` value, and `receiving_house` / `start_date` / `end_date` are backfilled from the linked absence. Orphan coverages (no linked absence or pointing to a deleted absence) end up with `receiving_house=''` and empty dates; cost accrues nowhere for those until Moran fills them in via the UI.
Cost contract. Coverage extras accrue to `receivingHouse`, not `coveringHouse`. Activeness depends on whether the coverage is linked to an absence:
Linked coverage (`absenceId` set): active iff today ∈ [`coverage.startDate`, `coverage.endDate`] AND the linked absence is active today. Closing the absence early — `endAbsence` pulls `absence.endDate` to today and flips status to `ended` — drops the coverage extra on the same day, even if `coverage.endDate` stretches further. Matches real-world substitute-pay logic: when the regular employee returns, the substitute stops being paid. Equivalent upper bound: `min(coverage.endDate, absence.endDate)`.
Unlinked coverage (`absenceId=''`) or dangling link (the absence has been deleted): active iff today ∈ [`coverage.startDate`, `coverage.endDate`]. No absence to tie to; the coverage row stands on its own. Same fall-through ensures `deleteAbsence` doesn't strand cost — the coverage keeps accruing on its own dates.
Validation. `validateCoverage` rejects `receivingHouse === coveringHouse` and requires `endDate ≥ startDate`. Server-side adds two cross-entity FK rules: (1) the covering worker must have an active assignment at `coveringHouse`; (2) when `absenceId` is set, the absence's house must equal `receivingHouse` AND the coverage's date range must overlap the absence's range. Hebrew error messages so the UI can surface them verbatim. `validateAbsence` now accepts empty `workerId` for stub rows (unfilled position, no identified absentee) — same shape as v2 migration produces, also creatable from the UI.
UI. Absence modal: dropped the "house" picker (set by opener); worker dropdown is filtered to workers with an active assignment at the house. Two-step "absence → prompt for coverage" flow is gone — `coveragePromptOverlay` and the accept/decline functions are removed. Coverage modal: rebuilt around the new independence — picks covering worker (filtered to current house), receiving house, optional linked absence (dependent dropdown that re-fetches when receiving house changes; shows only active absences at the receiving house), own start/end dates, and extraPayment. House view: separate `היעדרויות פעילות` and `החלפות פעילות` sections; coverages are no longer nested under absences; new `+ אירוע החלפה` button alongside `+ אירוע היעדרות`; the new section shows coverages where `coveringHouse === this house` (i.e. this house's workers helping elsewhere).
FK behavior. `deleteAbsence` no longer cascades to coverages and is no longer blocked by linked coverages — the link is reference-only. A coverage whose `absenceId` points at a deleted absence simply becomes an unlinked coverage; its dates + receivingHouse are intact, so cost attribution is unaffected.
Changed (carried from earlier in [Unreleased])
v3 UX rename pass: tighter Hebrew labels (`אירוע היעדרות` / `אירוע החלפה`); the `בית מתארח` concept is no longer surfaced in the UI. Strings-only commit — no logic, schema, or data-field changes. (The coverage source-house field was relabeled `בית מקור של המחליף/ה` in that commit; this commit removes the field entirely as part of the form rebuild.)
[3.0.0] — 2026-05-25 — Workers + per-house assignments + absence/coverage split
Major data-model redesign. The v2 "employee at a house" abstraction is replaced by worker × assignment — one worker can hold an assignment at multiple houses, each with its own role, employment type, and cost terms. The v2 coverage event (a single row mixing absentee + helper + bonus) is split into a normalized absence + coverage pair, so an absence can have zero, one, or many coverages, and coverage records survive the absence's end as audit history.
Core principle
A worker is an identity (name + notes). What they cost and where they work lives on their assignments — one row per (worker × house) pair. Cost is computed per-assignment per-type, never auto-split. When an absence is logged, it carries the house the worker is absent from; any coverage payment accrues to that house, not to wherever the covering worker comes from.
Cost attribution contract (v3)
```
assignmentCost(a)         = per-type:
                              full_time      → salary
                              part_time      → salary × pct/100
                              hourly         → hourlyRate × estHours
                              per_session    → sessionRate × estSessions
                              fixed_retainer → retainerAmount

houseAssignmentsCost(h)   = Σ assignmentCost(a) for a where a.house = h
coverageExtra(h, today)   = Σ c.extraPayment for c where c.absence.house = h
                            AND c.absence is active(today)
pendingHouseCost(h, today)= Σ frozen-cost over archive_v3 where house = h
                            AND terminationDate > today
houseTotal(h, today)      = houseAssignmentsCost(h)
                          + coverageExtra(h, today)
                          + pendingHouseCost(h, today)
networkTotal(today)       = Σ houseAssignmentsCost over all houses
                          + Σ coverageExtra over all active absences
                          + Σ pendingHouseCost over all houses
```
Each per-house assignment cost counts in exactly one house total (the assignment's own `house`). A worker with assignments in two houses contributes a cost line in each, with no double-counting. Coverage extras stack on top of the absent worker's house — independent of where the covering worker comes from. Pending terminations continue contributing until `terminationDate` arrives; on that day the archive row stops counting, matching the v2 semantics.
Data model
The Sheet now has five new tabs, all created idempotently by `setupSheetsV3`:
`workers` — `id | name | notes | created_at`. One row per person. The id is reused as `worker_id` everywhere (legacy migration reuses the v2 `employee_id` verbatim, no `w` prefix).
`assignments` — `id | worker_id | house | role | role_detail | employment_type | salary | pct | hourly_rate | est_hours | session_rate | est_sessions | retainer_amount | notes | created_at`. One row per worker × house. Each row carries its own per-type terms.
`absences` — `id | worker_id | house | start_date | end_date | reason_type | reason_detail | notes | status | created_at`. `house` is the house the worker is missing FROM (= "house needing coverage" in the UI). `status` is a hint; date math is the source of truth, and the reader lazily corrects stale `active` rows past their end date.
`coverages` — `id | absence_id | covering_worker_id | providing_house | extra_payment | notes | created_at`. Many-to-one against absences. The effective date range of a coverage is its parent absence's range.
`archive_v3` — `id | assignment_id | worker_id | name | house | role | role_detail | employment_type | salary | pct | hourly_rate | est_hours | session_rate | est_sessions | retainer_amount | notes | termination_date | reason_type | reason_detail | archived_at`. A frozen snapshot per terminated assignment, so cost reconstruction works without joining back to the live tables.
Legacy tabs (`ramot`/`asher`/`ofroni`/`rehab`, `events`, `history`, `archive`) are read but never modified by `migrateToV3` — the cutover writes new tabs and leaves the originals as a safety net. A separate `finalizeV3` step renames them to `_legacy_*` after a confidence window. See `MIGRATION.md` for the operational playbook.
Houses
Expanded from 4 to 7 codes (canonical id → Hebrew display name lives in `MIGRATION.md` "Houses"):
code	Hebrew display name
`ramot`	בית מאזן רמות השבים
`asher`	איזון רעננה - אשר
`ofroni`	קיסריה עפרוני
`rehab`	קיסריה ריהאב
`pardes`	איזון רעננה - פרדס (new)
`sde_eliezer`	שדה אליעזר (new)
`hq`	מטה (new — pseudo-house for HQ / admin staff)
Because v3 has no per-house Sheet tabs (rosters live in the unified `assignments` table keyed by `house`), the three new codes required no Sheet schema change — just an expansion of the validator's allow-list. `hq` is treated like any other house code by the data model; it's only semantically different.
API changes
Action allow-list — all v2 actions are gone, all v3 actions are new. The Express proxy (`/api/action`) and the Apps Script `doPost` both enforce this surface; calling a legacy action returns 400 with `unknown action`.
`createWorker` / `updateWorker` / `deleteWorker` — identity only. `deleteWorker` returns 409 if any assignment / absence / coverage / archive row references the worker (preserves history).
`addAssignment` — adds a per-house row. Rejects duplicate (worker × house) with 409.
`updateAssignment` — terms only; the (worker, house) pair is immutable for an existing row.
`deleteAssignment` — removes the row without touching the worker. No FK guard (assignments are leaves).
`terminateAssignment` — snapshots the assignment into `archive_v3`, removes the assignment row, and auto-truncates any active absence at the same (worker, house) to `end_date = terminationDate` (status recomputed against today). Future termination dates are supported — cost continues counting via `pendingHouseCost` until the date arrives.
`logAbsence` — adds an absence. Rejects overlapping active absences for the same (worker, house) with 409.
`endAbsence` — sets `end_date = today` (if currently after) and `status = 'ended'`.
`deleteAbsence` — returns 409 if any coverage references the absence (must delete coverages first).
`addCoverage` / `deleteCoverage` — link / unlink a covering worker against an existing absence. Server has no `updateCoverage` — to edit, delete and re-add.
Strict per-type assignment validation. `validateAssignment` (both `lib/validate.js` and the Apps Script mirror) rejects any cost field that doesn't belong to the chosen `employment_type` — e.g. `{employmentType: 'full_time', salary: 18000, hourlyRate: 80}` returns 400 with `hourlyRate not allowed for employmentType=full_time`. v2 silently zeroed those out; v3 surfaces the inconsistency. Zero / null / undefined / `""` for foreign fields stays accepted, so legacy → v3 migration round-trips cleanly (the mappers zero every non-applicable field).
Reason codes. `ABSENCE_REASON_TYPES` adds `אישי` (now 8 reasons). `TERMINATION_REASONS` is unchanged from v2.
`/api/data` (GET) returns both shapes during the transition: `{ workers, assignments, absences, coverages, archiveV3, houses, events, archive, _compat: true }`. The legacy passthrough keys are populated until `finalizeV3` renames the legacy tabs, after which they return empty arrays / objects.
UI changes
Shipped as three reviewable commits on top of the existing dark / gold theme:
Read-only views first (`92defb4`). New 7-house topbar + dashboard with `סה״כ עובדים/ות` (worker count) and `נעדרים פעילים היום` stat cards. Per-house view splits the roster into שכירים (`full_time` / `part_time` / `hourly`) and פרילנסרים (`per_session` / `fixed_retainer`) sub-groups. Absences are listed under a `נעדרים פעילים` section, each with their coverage(s) nested as `מחליף/ה: NAME (מבית X) · תוספת ₪Y`. Archive view reads `archive_v3`, sorted newest-first, with the `employmentType` shown alongside the role pill.
Worker + assignment forms (`a6a0fb5`). Adds `+ שיבוץ חדש` and the row actions (`עריכה` / `הפסקת עבודה` / `מחיקת שיבוץ`). The assignment dialog's fields swap by `employmentType` — only the type's allowed cost fields are visible, the notes field stays visible regardless of type. Worker names in the roster are clickable links that open a worker dialog; the assignment dialog's worker dropdown includes a `+ צור עובד/ת חדש/ה` pseudo-option that layers the worker dialog above and pre-selects the new worker on return. Client-side validation mirrors the server's strictness (foreign cost fields never POSTed; per-type required fields checked before the round-trip).
Two-step absence → coverage flow (`4ac2768`). `+ רישום היעדרות` opens the absence dialog. On save, a small follow-up modal asks `ההיעדרות נשמרה — לרשום מחליף/ה עכשיו?` — `הוסף מחליף/ה` opens the coverage dialog with the absence prelinked, `לא` closes and leaves the absence in its `ללא מחליף` state. The `ללא מחליף` prompt's `הוסף החלפה` button (placeholder'd in commit 1) is now active. Multiple coverages per absence are supported (`+ עוד מחליף/ה`). The absentee is filtered out of the covering-worker dropdown; picking a covering worker auto-defaults the providing house to one of their existing assignments. Active absences get `סיום` and (when no coverages reference them) `מחיקה` buttons.
Tests
`lib/calc.js` rewritten for v3 — per-type `assignmentCost`, `splitByCategory`, `houseTotal`, `networkTotal`, `coverageExtra`, `pendingHouseCost`. 60+ unit tests.
`lib/validate.js` rewritten — `validateWorker` / `validateAssignment` (with the strict per-type rejection) / `validateAbsence` / `validateCoverage` / `validateAction` (the v3 action allow-list). Tests cover every type's required + foreign-field combinations.
`lib/migrate.js` — pure v2 → v3 row mappers. Round-trip assertion confirms migrated rows still pass the v3 validator (the mappers zero foreign fields, which satisfies strictness).
`tests/server.test.js` rebuilt against a v3 fake upstream. Worker CRUD with FK guards, assignment lifecycle including per-type validation + termination + auto-truncate-absence, absence / coverage CRUD with the 409 FK guard on `deleteAbsence-while-coverage-exists`, all removed v2 actions verified as 400.
`tests/page-load.test.js` updated for the v3 surface — fetch stub returns v3 keys, `arch()` factory matches `archive_v3` row shape, `EZONE_CALC.assignmentCost` (not `cost`) is asserted on the destructure.
`tests/spelling.test.js` retained — repo-wide guard against the historical typo.
`smoke.js` rewritten — end-to-end through `createWorker` → `addAssignment` → `logAbsence` → `addCoverage` → cost-attribution sanity check → `terminateAssignment` → cleanup. Also probes the strict validator end-to-end (`full_time + hourlyRate` → expected 400 with the precise error). Not auto-run; manual invocation during release qualification (requires a real Apps Script test sheet).
158/158 unit + integration tests pass.
Migration / rollout
See `MIGRATION.md` for the full playbook. Summary:
Phase 1 — test on a copy. Make a copy of the production Sheet, bind a separate Apps Script project to it, paste the v3 `Code.gs`, set the test `SHEET_ID` + `SHARED_SECRET` script properties, deploy a test Web App, run `setupSheetsV3` → `dryRunMigrateToV3` → `migrateToV3`. Verify against the v3 UI locally pointed at the test Web App. `rollbackV3` is supported and idempotent.
Phase 2 — production cutover. Paste `Code.gs` into the production Apps Script project, deploy a new Web App version (URL unchanged), run `setupSheetsV3` → `dryRunMigrateToV3` → `migrateToV3`. Push the v3 branch to Railway; reload.
Finalize after stable operation. `finalizeV3` renames the legacy tabs to `_legacy_*`. The v3 UI is unaffected (it only reads the v3 tabs). After finalize, the legacy passthrough keys in `/api/data` return empty.
Rollback is safe at every stage. Pre-`finalizeV3`: redeploy the v2 `Code.gs` from the deployment dropdown, run `rollbackV3` to drop the v3 tabs. Post-`finalizeV3`: redeploy v2, rename `_legacy_*` back, run `rollbackV3`. Worst case: restore from the manual production-Sheet copy made in the pre-flight step.
Removed
All v2 actions. `addEmployee` / `updateEmployee` / `deleteEmployee` / `moveEmployee` / `startCoverage` / `endCoverage` / `terminateEmployee` are gone. Calling them returns 400. The v2 client cannot operate against the v3 server; the deploy order matters (Apps Script first, then Railway picks up the new UI).
Per-house Sheet tabs as the source of truth for who works where. They're still read for the migration's input, and they survive under `_legacy_*` after `finalizeV3` as an audit trail — but no new code writes to them.
[2.1.2] — 2026-05-22 — Archive on a dedicated page + Hebrew typo fix
Spelling: section header had the wrong Hebrew — an extra ו between the leading א and the ר (the typo can't be written literally here because `tests/spelling.test.js` would catch it). The correct Hebrew is `ארכיב` (no ו after the א). Fixed every occurrence in `public/index.html` and `CHANGELOG.md`. New `tests/spelling.test.js` walks the whole repo on every test run and asserts the typo never appears again, plus asserts the dashboard nav uses the correctly-spelled `ארכיב עובדים`.
Archive moved off the dashboard: the collapsed `ארכיב עובדים` section is gone from `centralView`. The archive now lives on its own SPA view, reached via a small `ארכיב עובדים` link in the topbar (right of the house tabs, before `יציאה`). Same dark-navy + gold theme; the view has its own page title, a single accent stat card showing the total, and the full table sorted newest-first.
Auth gating unchanged but pinned: the archive view is part of the same SPA, gated by the existing PIN flow — `boot()` only renders any view (including archive) after `loadData()` succeeds against the auth-required `/api/data` endpoint. A new page-load test asserts this explicitly: with no token, the PIN overlay shows, the app container stays hidden, and no `.archive-table` ever reaches the DOM.
No Apps Script changes — the data contract (`{ houses, events, archive }`) is unchanged. Railway picks this up on push; no manual redeploy needed.
Tests added
`tests/spelling.test.js`: repo-wide grep for the wrong spelling (extra ו), plus the dashboard's `ארכיב עובדים` correctness check.
`tests/page-load.test.js`: dashboard view does NOT contain `.archive-table`; archive view renders archive rows sorted newest-first; PIN gate shows when there's no token (and no archive content leaks into the hidden app container). A new `authAndBoot()` helper seeds a session token via `localStorage`, stubs `fetch`, and awaits `boot()` so tests can drive the post-auth state deterministically.
[2.1.0] — 2026-05-21 — Termination flow + archive + dashboard tweaks
Adds an explicit "end of employment" workflow with an archive tab, removes the past-events list from the dashboard, and tightens the row actions.
Termination flow (new)
New row-action button `הפסקת עבודה` opens a dialog: required termination date (defaults to today, future dates are allowed — explicit support for the "schedule end of employment for end of month" workflow), optional reason from `התפטרות / פיטורין / סיום חוזה / מעבר תפקיד / אחר`, optional note.
New API action `terminateEmployee`. Under a script lock the Apps Script: snapshots the employee row from their home tab, auto-truncates any `active` coverage event whose subject is this employee (`end_date = min(current_end, terminationDate)`, status recomputed against today), appends to the new `archive` tab, then deletes the row from the home tab.
The action is the natural cleanup: the employee disappears from the active roster everywhere immediately, while their cost continues to count until `terminationDate` arrives (see contract below).
Cost attribution contract (extended)
```
pendingTerminations(archive, today) = archive rows where termination_date > today
pendingHomeCost(house)              = Σ salary × pct/100 over pending terminations whose home_house = house
homeCost(house)                     = Σ base × pct/100 over active roster + pendingHomeCost(house)
hostBonus(house)                    = unchanged: Σ event.bonusAmount where host_house = house AND active(today)
houseTotal(house)                   = homeCost(house) + hostBonus(house)
networkTotal                        = Σ homeCost(all) + Σ active bonuses
```
Base salary still appears in exactly one house total. A terminated employee with `termination_date > today` continues to count in their home house (no double-count, just deferred). On the day `today >= termination_date`, the archive row stops contributing — and because the action also pulls any of their active events' `end_date` in to `termination_date`, any associated bonus stops on the same day. The auto-truncation means the existing `isActive`/`activeBonus` logic naturally handles terminated subjects without a separate guard.
Data model
New `archive` tab (13 columns):
```
  id | employee_id | name | role | role_detail | salary | pct | notes |
  home_house | termination_date | reason_type | reason_detail | archived_at
  ```
The snapshot lets cost reconstruction work without joining back to the active roster (the row is gone from the home tab by the time the dashboard renders).
`setupSheets()` adds it idempotently.
House tabs, events tab, and history tab are unchanged.
API changes
`terminateEmployee` action added.
`/api/data` response shape grows: `{ houses, events, archive }`. The client tolerates the field being missing (old Apps Script deploys still work; archive defaults to `[]`).
All other actions are unchanged.
UI changes
Dashboard section heading renamed: `אירועי כיסוי פעילים` → `שיבוץ החלפות בין בתים` (both the stat-card label and the section H2).
The `אירועי כיסוי קודמים` section is removed from the dashboard. The data still gets recorded in the `events` tab — the Sheet stays the audit-of-record. The dashboard simply doesn't render past events anymore.
New section `ארכיב עובדים` replaces it in the same screen position. Read-only table with `שם · בית · תפקיד · תאריך סיום · סיבה · הערה`. Rows are sorted by termination date, newest first. Dates render `DD/MM/YYYY` via the existing helper. (Moved to a dedicated SPA view in [2.1.2].)
Row action buttons restyled and reordered: `תיעוד מעבר · עריכה · הפסקת עבודה · מחיקה`. Default is the visible outline (no longer using the `--muted` ghost). Two new hover modifiers — `.btn-accent-hover` (gold tint, used on `עריכה`) and `.btn-danger-hover` (soft red, used on `הפסקת עבודה` and `מחיקה`).
House cards show a `כולל עובדים בתקופת הודעה {₪}` sub-line when there are pending terminations whose date is still in the future.
Tests
`tests/calc.test.js`: pending-termination assertions (past date contributes 0, future date still contributes, no double-counting in `networkTotal`, backward-compat when `archive` arg is omitted).
`tests/validate.test.js`: `terminateEmployee` happy-path, accepts future dates, accepts missing reason, rejects unknown reason, rejects missing fields, rejects malformed date, caps long reasonDetail.
`tests/server.test.js`: add → terminate round-trip (gone from roster + present in archive + active event auto-ended to terminationDate); future-date variant (event stays `active` until then).
`smoke.js`: rewritten — add employee → start coverage → cost-attribution sanity check → terminate today (this is also the cleanup) → assert employee gone from roster, in archive, event auto-ended to today with `status=ended`, ramot home cost back to baseline, events +1 + archive +1. The previous `endCoverage` + `deleteEmployee` smoke steps are subsumed by the termination flow.
Migration / rollout
Pull main; the Express server can deploy as soon as Railway picks up the push.
Redeploy `apps-script/Code.gs` to the bound Apps Script project (paste in the editor, Manage Deployments → edit existing → New version → Deploy).
Run `setupSheets()` once in the Apps Script editor — idempotent, adds the `archive` tab if missing.
No data migration needed; `archive` starts empty.
[2.0.0] — 2026-05-21 — Coverage event model
Major redesign of how staff transfers are recorded. The old "move employee from house A to house B" model is replaced by a temporary-coverage model.
Core principle
Every employee has one home house. Their base salary always stays attributed to the home house. Transfers between houses are always temporary coverage events with an optional bonus paid to the helping employee. Base salary is never double-counted.
Cost attribution rules (contract)
```
homeCost(house)    = Σ (employee.salary × pct/100) for employees living here
hostBonus(house)   = Σ event.bonusAmount  where host_house = house AND active(today)
houseTotal(house)  = homeCost(house) + hostBonus(house)
networkTotal       = Σ homeCost(all houses) + Σ active bonuses

active(today)      ⇔ start_date ≤ today ≤ end_date     (inclusive)
```
Base salary appears in exactly one house total (the home). Bonuses appear only while active, only in the host. `status` in the sheet is a hint — date math is the source of truth, and the backend lazily corrects stale `active` rows to `ended` on every read.
Data model
House tabs (`ramot`/`asher`/`ofroni`/`rehab`): added column 7 `role_detail` for role specialization. Employees stay in their home tab permanently.
New `events` tab: `id | employee_id | employee_name | home_house | host_house | start_date | end_date | reason_type | reason_detail | covers_employee_id | bonus_amount | status | created_at`.
Legacy `history` tab is kept untouched as a backup. Run `migrateHistoryToEvents()` in Apps Script once after deploy to copy every legacy row into `events` as a single-day `ended` event.
API changes
`moveEmployee` action — removed.
`startCoverage` — new. Server rejects overlapping active events for the same employee (HTTP 409) and rejects same home/host.
`endCoverage` — new. Sets `end_date = today` (if still in future) and marks `status = 'ended'`.
`/api/data` response shape: `{ houses, events }`. The `history` key is gone.
`addEmployee` / `updateEmployee`: `role` is constrained to a closed set of 9 dropdown values; `roleDetail` field added (required when `role === 'אחר'`).
`REASON_TYPES` updated to: `חופשה`, `חל״ת`, `מחלה`, `חופשת לידה`, `ניתוח`, `צורך תפעולי`, `אחר`.
UI changes
Accent color switched to burnt orange (`#A4561F`) so the app is visually distinct from the other E-ZONE apps.
Role field is a dropdown of 9 values. Conditional second field appears for "מטפל/ת" (התמחות / סוג טיפול) and "אחר" (פרט/י תפקיד).
Move dialog replaced with "תיעוד מעבר זמני" including `מחליף/ה את` dropdown and bonus amount.
Home view: roster rows get a badge "כרגע עוזר/ת ב{X} עד {Y}" when employee has an active outgoing event.
Host view: new section "עוזרים זמניים / כיסוי" listing incoming active coverage. Base salary stays out of this house's totals — only the bonus is counted.
Central dashboard: new "אירועי כיסוי פעילים" section above the renamed "אירועי כיסוי קודמים" (was "היסטוריית העברות"). House cards show home count + house total (with a "כולל בונוסי כיסוי" line when applicable).
Migration / rollout
Re-deploy `apps-script/Code.gs` to the bound Apps Script project. Run `setupSheets()` — idempotently adds the `events` tab and appends `role_detail` as column 7 of each house tab.
Run `migrateHistoryToEvents()` once to backfill ended events from the legacy `history` tab.
Existing employees whose `role` isn't in the new dropdown still display correctly. On first edit, the form defaults them to `role = 'אחר'` with the original text preserved in `roleDetail`.
Removed
The stale standalone `ezone-staffing.html` at the repo root (which was not served by Express).
[1.0.0] — 2026-05-19
Initial cloud release. Prototype `ezone-staffing.html` (localStorage-only) converted to a full Express + Apps Script + Google Sheets app.
Added
`apps-script/Code.gs` — `doGet`/`doPost` web app with `addEmployee`, `updateEmployee`, `deleteEmployee`, `moveEmployee`. Move is atomic under a `LockService` script lock and appends to an append-only `history` tab. Shared-secret auth via `secret=` query param. Includes a `setupSheets()` helper that creates the five tabs with header rows on first run.
`apps-script/appsscript.json` — Web App manifest, executes as user, anyone can call (security via shared secret).
`server.js` — Express proxy. Routes:
`GET /api/health`
`POST /api/login` — PIN gate, returns an HMAC-signed session token. Rate-limited to 8 attempts per 15 minutes per IP.
`GET /api/data` and `POST /api/action` — auth-gated, proxied to Apps Script with `SHARED_SECRET` injected server-side. Apps Script URL is never exposed to the browser.
`lib/auth.js` — HMAC-SHA256 stateless session tokens, constant-time PIN comparison via `crypto.timingSafeEqual`.
`lib/validate.js` — Server-side input validation: house allowlist, employee field trimming + length caps, ISO date format, reason-type allowlist, same-source-and-target rejection.
`lib/calc.js` — Shared (CommonJS + browser) helpers for cost computation, weighted totals, gross totals, average percentage.
`public/index.html` — Cloud version of the prototype. PIN gate overlay, boot spinner, Hebrew error toasts, busy-state buttons, automatic re-prompt on token expiry. UI/RTL/visual design preserved verbatim from the prototype. Client output is HTML-escaped.
`tests/` — Node built-in test runner. Covers calc rounding, token sign/verify/tamper/expiry, validation rules, and full HTTP round-trips (add/update/delete/move + history append) against a mocked Apps Script upstream.
`README.md` — End-to-end setup, deploy steps, API contract, security notes.
`railway.json` — Railway build/deploy config.
Security
Three independent secrets, all in env vars: `SHARED_SECRET` (server↔Apps Script), `MORAN_PIN` (gate), `SESSION_SECRET` (token signing).
Server refuses to start without all four required env vars (or `SESSION_SECRET` shorter than 32 chars).
Constant-time comparisons for both PIN and token signature.
All inputs validated server-side before reaching Apps Script; Apps Script re-validates.
Apps Script URL is server-only; the browser only talks to `/api/*`.
